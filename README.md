## üöÄ Usage

### Simple Port Scanner

```bash
python3 fast_port_scanner.py <TARGET> <START_PORT> <END_PORT> <THREADS>
```

### Network Discovery Tool

```bash
python3 network_scanner.py <SUBNET>
# Example: 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Basic HTTP Sniffer

```bash
python3 scapy_sniffer.py <INTERFACE>
# Example: Wi-Fi or eth0
```


### Information Gathering Tool

```bash
python3 information_gather.py -d <DOMAIN> [-s <IP>] 
```

> Use your own Shodan API key inside the script for Shodan lookups.
